# MasterProject

folder Configuration: configuration document for asynchronous simulation in PeerSim with 6 different graphs.
folder MSE_data_0219: the output evaluation data including MSE and discrepancy that has been produced after simulation in PeerSim, and will be used in the python file.
folder self_stabilizing_load_balancing: java file that has been added into PeerSim to simulate the algorithm: self-stabilizing load balancing algorithm.

Graph_implement_output.ipynb: output the graph for WS small world network and BA scale free network from low network size to large.
output_graph_plot.ipynb: output the curve for MSE and Discrepancy, do the fitting curve for them, and combine two curves to compare.
