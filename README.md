# MasterProject

**folder Configuration**: configuration document for asynchronous simulation in PeerSim with 6 different graphs.  

**folder MSE_data_0219**: the output evaluation data including MSE and discrepancy that has been produced after simulation in PeerSim, and will be used in the python file.  

**folder self_stabilizing_load_balancing**: java file that used with PeerSim to simulate the algorithm: self-stabilizing load balancing algorithm.  

**WireER.java**: java file that used in PeerSim/src/dynamics for implementing the ER random graph. (Other graphs are built-in PeerSim)

**Graph_implement_output.ipynb**: output the graph for WS small world network and BA scale free network from low network size to large.  

**output_graph_plot.ipynb**: output the curve for MSE and Discrepancy, do the fitting curve for them, and combine two curves to compare.
